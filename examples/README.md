## What is this?

This is a repository showing how different tracing API can be used to instrument simple applications

## How does this work?

Fork the repository and have a look at the template for the example to be instrumented. Create a new folder for your tracing API and contribute 
the template code plus your tracing code. 

## Does my example need to work out-of-the-box?

Obviously, tracing backends are needed to collect the data from the API. Ideally, everyone who wants to try the example can do this because the
backend is provided open-source or as a trial for commercial products. 

Even without the backend the the example should compile and work. Tracing code should never break an application; even when the backend is not 
available
