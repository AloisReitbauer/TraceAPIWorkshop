# Agenda Tracing API Workshop April 2018


## Purpose of the meeting

Currently different vendors/implementor use proprietary APIs to implement tracing for custom code. The [OpenTracing](https://github.com/opentracing) 
aims at providing a uniform standard for APIs that can be used primarily by framework implementors and also end users. 

However, today each vendor has their own implementation. The goal of this workshop is to compare the invidual implementations and define the common ground as well as further items for discussion.

This first workshop is targeted at **tracing framework providers**. In the future there will also discussions with framework implementors.

## Tracing Examples

The workshop will be very practically oriented. The basis for discussion is instrumentation of [example "micro" applications](https://github.com/AloisReitbauer/TraceAPIWorkshop/tree/master/examples). These examples should be instrumented with *raw* tracing calls rather than more advanced approaches like auto-instrumentation, library wrapping etc.
